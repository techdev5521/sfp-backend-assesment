# SFP Backend Assesment

This repo was forked from https://gitlab.sfp.cc/sfp/sfp-backend-assessment and serves only for review purposes.

### Next Steps
If I were to better these three classes, I would want to do the following:

- Find out more about the constraints of the data pipeline to evaluate more edge cases and improve code flexibility.
- Read more about PHPDocs and standardize documentation.
- Add proper logging support and perhaps return code support if appropriate.


### Usage
**1. Clone this repo:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/techdev5521/sfp-backend-assesment.git
```

**2, Run `index.php`:**

```bash
php index.php
```
